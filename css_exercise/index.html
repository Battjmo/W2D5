    It could not be any cooler, wow, Drake ain't got nothin'
    on this text. Alter the styling on this new container so that it's width still defaults to 200px but now it can grow to accomodate any image. Hint hint, it's something you used earlier to accomodate your other children. Remember that div elements are blocks and will take up the whole width of the window if you don't constrain them, so you might want to change them to inline-blocks or something.</p></div>
